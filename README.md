## About Laravel-Todo

This is a web system built for myself for to keep track of my professional work tasks, and display publicly (to the team) so, the task-assigners will know which days are already occupied of me. Making the code available as one of my portfolio items, and for anyone who wants to make their homework easier.

Feel free to contribute, report bugs, and/or improve it. That helps us all.

## How to get it running

If you want to deploy as is, just clone it and it will run on a configured PHP server (cPanel etc.).

If you want to develop or clone with the required environment, Docker is here.

Run `vendor/bin/sail up` for that.

## Configuration

As common with laravel, you have to duplicate (copy-paste & rename) `.env.example` to `.env` and set the nessasary valeus such as DB URLs, Application name etc.
